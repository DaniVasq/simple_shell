# Simple Shell

This is a Simple Shell for the Holberton School Simple Shell project. In this project, we use functions, system calls, created processes with fork (child and parent), prototypes, how the shell uses PATH to find programs, and how to execute another program with the execve system call, as well as how to suspend the execution of a process until on its children terminates. We also implement the EOF condition and exit status.

# Getting Started

In order to pull up the shell, you'll need to type ./filename.
